This is a portfolio for my Junior year of Web and App Development.

The work present here is coded using the 'Python'. 'Python' is an object-based coding language that is useful for automation, software development, data science, and other tasks that HTML and CSS are not capable of.

Currently, there are five index files, six folders, and 9 units of codework.
